# Product Description  

Most productivity apps make you feel busier, not better.  
You end up stuck in reaction mode—always busy, rarely fulfilled.  
Goals stay vague, daily actions drift, and external demands take over.  

## The problem with today’s apps  
- They pile on setup work.  
- They show endless lists when you’re already overwhelmed.  
- They ignore your energy, timing, and context.  
- They turn missed plans into guilt.  
- They collapse when your day changes.  

## Our promise: alignment, not clutter  
Here’s how it works:  
- Start your day with a short conversation to unload what’s on your mind.  
- Get one clear starting action and one or two support steps.  
- See a quick summary and choose a gentle check-in.  
- If you miss, simply shrink or move the step—no judgment.  
- Track progress by starts, completions, and streaks, not bloated task lists.  

## The goal  
Steady momentum. Less friction. More focus.  
A system that helps you act on what matters—and stay aligned with it.
