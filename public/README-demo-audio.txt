# Audio File Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the demo audio file that should be placed in this directory.

## File Details:
- Filename: demo-audio.mp3
- Purpose: Demonstration audio for the "Hear how it works" feature on the landing page
- Content: A 20-30 second clip demonstrating the product in action (unloading thoughts → system distills → plays back one clear step)

Please place the actual MP3 file in this directory with the filename "demo-audio.mp3".
